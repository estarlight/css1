		<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
		<p>
		JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser of Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

			<li>
				<a href = "">Variable Declaration</a> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <font style="color:slateblue">var x;</font>
			</li><br>
			<li>
				<a href = "">Variable Assignment</a> Assignemnt operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <font style="color:slateblue">var x = 10;</font>
			</li><br>
			<li>
				<a href = "">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <font style="color:slateblue">true</font> or <font style="color:slateblue">false;</font> null - <font style="color:slateblue">null</font> aka nothing; Number <font style="color:slateblue">- 42</font> or <font style="color:slateblue">3.14159;</font> String - <font style="color:slateblue">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</font> Array - <font style="color:slateblue">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</font> and Object - <font style="color:slateblue">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</font>
			</li><br>
			<li>
				<a href = "">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. THere are the following conditional statements: <font style="color:slateblue">if</font> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <font style="color:slateblue">else if</font> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <font style="color:slateblue">else</font> we execute this block of code;
			</li><br>
			<li>
				<a href = "">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
			</li><br>
			<li>
				<a href = "">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so let's call our function over and over and over again.
